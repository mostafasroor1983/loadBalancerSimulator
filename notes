How many servers do you want to sever using load balancer?
What is the selection method do you want to do?

====
Load balancer in mechanism that can be implemented by reverse proxy to organize
requests and load on many servers to be more productive and make high availablility and relaibility.

There are many algorithms that orgnize load on servers such as randomly, round robin, weight round robin.
I will try to implement load balancer that simulate all that three algorithms.

I will use ip of server to select server.
